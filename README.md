# bookstore

Simulate a bookstore environment by purchasing items, joining a membership program or donating used goods!

This bookstore contains 3 types of items: Books, CDs and DVDs. From a list of default inventory, users can purchase a number of items from any type and will be shown the total price of their purchase order. Users can also join a membership program as a member or premium member, and can donate used books, CDs and DVDs which will then be resold at the store.

Read, watch and listen to your heart's content at the bookstore!

This project originally began as a course project for a class.
